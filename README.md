## Description

 The design and assessment of orthopaedic implants for the replacement of the diseased shoulder is an important process in the development of these implant systems. We have developed a specialized test-bed that assesses the fixation and stability of implants relative to bone. This employs high resolution machine-vision cameras to quantify implant stability, and a specialized loading protocol based on published clinical loading data collected via instrumented implants (Figure 1). We have the ability to quantify bone-implant fixation (viz. micromotion) to an accuracy of less than 10 microns. With respect to the loading protocols, we have found that the use of anatomically relevant loading states produces a much more robust testing approach relative to the currently used techniques which employ simply planar force loading scenarios. The system is standalone which allows us to assess and implant design for a wide sequence of loading states before replacing the specimen with a subsequent implant and repeating the extensive loading protocol. All data collected by the new system is synchronized with the loading input values and exported for easy statistical analysis.
